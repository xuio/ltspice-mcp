# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in LTspice MCP, please report it privately to the maintainers instead of opening a public issue.

Include:

- affected version
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- suggested mitigation (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as quickly as possible.

## Scope

Security reports should focus on vulnerabilities in this repository's code, tooling, and default operational behavior.
